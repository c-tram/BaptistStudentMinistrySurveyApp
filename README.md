samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

To run the project, please download and install Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/

Once VSCode is installed, select the extensions tab on the left-hand side of the screen. Search for, and install, the:
1) Dart extension
2) Flutter extension

In the console, be sure to type 'flutter pub get' to update all dependencies for the pubspec.yaml file

Run 'flutter doctor' in the terminal to see if you have the following software installed:
1) Flutter
2) Windows
3) Chrome
4) Visual Studio
5) Android Toolchain

Once these have all been installed, change the target build device to Chrome(web-javascript) to successfully render the app

To run the app, navigate to the file named main.dart, and then select 'Start Debugging'. The app should take around 15 seconds to launch in the Chrome browser.
